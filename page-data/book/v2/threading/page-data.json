A parent thread can trigger multiple child threads, whuch could cascade to multiple levels of nested message threads (for example, issuing a credential triggers payment, which in turn triggers feature discovery). Parent threads and child threads do not have a simple containment or ownership relationship. By definition, a parent is only a trigger — not necessarily a controller or stakeholder. A parent thread has no guarantees about its lifecycle and could end before or after any of its child threads. Parent and child threads also can interact or share data, but are not required to do so. (How they do so is out of scope in this spec, but see <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0478-coprotocols/README.md\">Coprotocols</a> for one way to approach this.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"Parent-and-Child-Examples\">Parent and Child Examples</h4>\n<p>Creating a connection is a classic interaction that lends itself to a parent-child paradigm. Alice and Bob rarely connect just to connect; usually they connect so they can conduct some type of business. In such situations, the connection protocol is a parent thread, and whatever business they then conduct becomes a child.</p>\n<p>Reporting and resolving errors and warnings is also a good use case for parent and child threads. It is true that problems can be communicated in specialized messages of an individual protocol; some protocols may make this choice. However, problems are often the gateway to deeper troubleshooting or even support tickets, which are complex workflows in their own right. Also, robust mechanisms for logging, analyzing, and reacting to problems may be reusable in many workflows. For this reason, it is recommended to model problem reporting as a child protocol, with an arbitrarily complex thread of messages as child to the parent workflow that triggered them.
