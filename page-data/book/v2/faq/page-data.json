A sender might be using HTTPS, but perhaps part of the route is not. Using channel-oriented encryption (e.g., TLS) on the part of the channel you can see is not actually secure, if someone somewhere has to take plaintext off that channel and put it somewhere else that you don't know about. The guarantee is supposed to be end-to-end. (In our question #2 above, \"Bob\" is the end; what he does after it gets to him is his business, not DIDComm's.
