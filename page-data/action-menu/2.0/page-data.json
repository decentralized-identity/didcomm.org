The protocol allows limited service discovery as well as simple data entry. While less flexible than HTML forms or a chat bot, it should be relatively easy to implement and provides a user interface which can be adapted for various platforms, including mobile agents.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Motivation\">Motivation</h1>\n<p>Discovery of a peer Agent's capabilities or service offerings is currently reliant on knowledge obtained out-of-band. There is no in-band DIDComm supported protocol for querying a peer to obtain a human freindly menu of their capabilities or service offerings. Whilst this protocol doesn't offer ledger wide discovery capabilities, it will allow one User Agent connected to another, to present a navigable menu and request offered services. The protocol also provides an interface definition language to define action menu display, selection and request submission.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Roles\">Roles</h2>\n<p>There are two roles in this protocol:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>requester</code>: The <code>requester</code> asks the <code>responder</code> for menu definitions, presents them to a user, and initiates subsequent action items from the menu through further requests to the <code>responder</code>.</li>\n<li><code>responder</code>: The <code>responder</code> presents an initial menu definition containing actionable elements to a <code>requester</code> and then responds to subsequent action requests from the menu.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Basic-Walkthrough\">Basic Walkthrough</h2>\n<p>The action-menu protocol requires an active DIDComm connection before it can proceed. One Agent behaves as a <code>requester</code> in the protocol whilst the other Agent represents a <code>responder</code>. Conceptually the <code>responder</code> presents a list of actions which can be initiated by the <code>requester</code>. Actions are contained within a menu structure. Individual Actions may result in traversal to another menu or initiation of other protocols such as a presentation request, an introduction proposal, a credential offer, an acknowledgement, or a problem report.</p>\n<p>The protocol can be initiated by either the <code>requester</code> asking for the root menu or the <code>responder</code> sending an unsolicited root menu. The protocol ends when the <code>requester</code> issues a perform operation or an internal timeout on the <code>responder</code> causes it to discard menu context. At any time a <code>requester</code> can reset the protocol by requesting the root menu from a <code>responder</code>.</p>\n<p>Whilst the protocol is defined here as uni-directional (i.e requester to responder), both Agents may support both requester and responder roles simultaneously. Such cases would result in two instances of the action-menu protocol operating in parrallel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"States\">States</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KZ78KDxmXdck068aJpn-7BbDNfeaTcUyDgk6b2efCxc/edit?usp=sharing\"><img src=\"state-machines.png\" alt=\"state machines\"></a></p>\n<h4 id=\"States-for-Requester\">States for Requester</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State        </th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>null</td>\n<td>No <em>menu</em> has been requested or received</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>awaiting-root-menu</td>\n<td><em>menu-request</em> message has been sent and awaiting root <em>menu</em> response</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>preparing-selection</td>\n<td><em>menu</em> message has been received and a user selection is pending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>done</td>\n<td><em>perform</em> message has been sent and protocol has finished.
