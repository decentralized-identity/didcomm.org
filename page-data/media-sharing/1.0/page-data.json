However, due to the fact that it is transport-agnostic and generic enough to be run in a wide range of agents, exchanging <em>inlined</em> data through this channel only might not be as efficient (in terms of bandwith and CPU power) as doing so by using other mechanisms, especially when a large amount of data is being shared and more than a single pair of devices are involved in such exchange (e.g. multi-party connections or peers who are using more than a device).</p>\n<p>For such cases, this protocol is defined to share data <em>by reference</em>, relying on third-party services to do the actual upload/storage/download. Depending on the trust on such third-party services, files can be previously encrypted or simply left as plain data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Roles\">Roles</h2>\n<p>There are two roles in this protocol:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sender</code> - The agent willing to share media files</li>\n<li><code>receiver</code> - The agent that will receive the shared media</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Basic-Walkthrough\">Basic Walkthrough</h2>\n<p>In an initial file sharing, the <em>sender</em> will typically generate content encryption keys (CEK) for each file they want to share. This step could be omitted in case of media items that are encoded inline in DIDComm channel.</p>\n<p>Then, it will upload encrypted contents in such a way that they are accesible in an URI reachable by the recipient.</p>\n<p>With this information, it will generate the <strong>share-media</strong> message that will be received by the <em>receiver</em>, who will download and decrypt all shared files the message might contain. If requested, it will answer with an ack confirming the correct reception of the message (however, this does not mean it could properly interpret or download each shared file). <code>problem-report</code> could be used to inform the sender about any issue downloading or decrypting the contents (TODO: define error codes).</p>\n<!--\n```plantuml\n@startuml\ntitle Media sharing basic flow\n\nparticipant \"Sender\" as SA\nparticipant \"Receiver\" as RA\nparticipant \"File Server\" as FS\n\nSA -> SA: CEK = GenKey()\nSA -> SA: F = Enc (File, CEK)\nSA -> FS: attachment.link = upload(F)\nSA -> RA: share-media(CEK, attachment)\nRA -> FS: F = download(attachment.link)\nRA -> RA: File = Dec (F, CEK)\n\n@enduml\n```\n-->\n<p><img src=\"/25dfd2ef027a75c6a162497d43790690/media-sharing-basic-flow.png\" alt=\"Media sharing basic flow\"></p>\n<p>There is another possible flow, where the protocol is started by the request of a previously shared file that appears to not be available by the recipient (e.g. they deleted the file locally and the sender has already deleted it as well from the shared file server).</p>\n<p>In such case, the protocol starts with a <strong>request-media</strong> message which should use the original protocol thid as pthid.</p>\n<!--\n```plantuml\n@startuml\ntitle Media sharing as response of a requested file\n\nparticipant \"Sender\" as SA\nparticipant \"Receiver\" as RA\nparticipant \"File Server\" as FS\n\nRA -> SA: request-media(desc, pthid=share-files thid)\nSA -> SA: CEK = GenKey()\nSA -> SA: F = Enc (File, CEK)\nSA -> FS: item.links[0] = upload(F)\nSA -> RA: share-media(CEK, item)\nRA -> FS: F = download(item.links[0])\nRA -> RA: File = Dec (F, CEK)\n\n@enduml\n```\n-->\n<p><img src=\"/35a98d39faaff19dd599432bdcb6446a/media-sharing-as-response.png\" alt=\"Media sharing as response\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"States\">States</h2>\n<p>Depending on the role, the following states are possible:</p>\n<h4 id=\"Sender-states\">Sender states</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>media-requested</li>\n<li>media-shared</li>\n<li>done</li>\n</ul>\n<!--\n```plantuml\nstate \"init\" as Init\nstate \"media-requested\" as FileRequested\nstate \"media-shared\" as FileShared\n[*] -> Init\nInit -> FileRequested\nFileRequested -> FileShared\nInit -> FileShared\nFileShared -> Done\nDone -> [*]\n```\n-->\n<p><img src=\"/5de85979871e6386dacecbec0161b218/media-sharing-sender-states.png\" alt=\"Sender states\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"Receiver-states\">Receiver states</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>media-requested</li>\n<li>media-received</li>\n<li>done</li>\n</ul>\n<!--\n```plantuml\nstate \"init\" as Init\nstate \"media-requested\" as FileRequested\nstate \"media-received\" as FileReceived\n[*] -> Init\nInit -> FileRequested\nFileRequested -> FileReceived\nInit -> FileReceived\nFileReceived -> Done\nDone -> [*]\n```\n-->\n<p><img src=\"/c4681702d1a5d591e9c1796982037ff7/media-sharing-receiver-states.png\" alt=\"Receiver states\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Message-Reference\">Message Reference</h2>\n<p>This protocol currently defines a few specific messages, but uses DIDComm core mechanisms such as attachments and localization (and may use other extensions) to enrich the flow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Share-Media\">Share Media</h3>\n<p>Through this message, a sender can share a number of media items, each of them referencing to an <a href=\"https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#attachments\">attachment</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/7759addb1506d107fddec692403bbc9e55fe491f/concepts/0017-attachments/README.md#appending\">appended attachment</a> in case of DIDComm v1), adding a few optional fields regarding the nature of the media being shared.</p>\n<p>Appended attachments MUST define at least an <code>id</code> and a <code>media_type</code> (DIDComm v1) or <code>mime-type</code> (DIDComm v2), in order to be properly identified and classified.</p>\n<p>The message may indicate the language used for the description.
